## Spring Boot
How to spin a new application from scratch using Spring Boot?

### Introduction
I got a chance in the begining of last year to explore Spring Boot as part of the modernizing effort at work. Within few minutes, I realized how easy is to spin a new application from scratch using Spring Boot. From that moment onwards, all my new applications are Spring Boot applications.

### About This Post
This first post is part of Spring Boot series. In this post I will explain how to create a simple spring boot application and running it in the local machine.

### First Thing First
>_Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run"_ 
-- [Spring Boot Project](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

It is a openionated platform with Spring & other 3rd party liberaries to bring up an application with less configuration.

Since it runs on top of Spring platform it supports all spring configurations and annotations.

### Creating An Application

In this post I will develop a hello world application with a rest simple service.

#### Initializing The Application
